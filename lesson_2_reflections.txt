When you initialize a repository, an empty 
folder called .git is created in the working 
directory.  You need to do it in order to start
committing changes made to files.

The staging area holds chosen files from the working directory
before they are committed to the repository.  This allows the
user to choose which files are to be added to the repository.

You can use the staging area to make sure you have one commit 
per logical change by comparing what is in the staging area
to what is in the last commit in the repository.

Branches are helpful when there are multiple distinct versions
of a project that all are current.  Branches help to keep those
changes separate and to allow the user to switch between them
easily.

Diagrams help you visualize the branch structure by showing the 
path of the commits across branches.  This makes it easy to find
the last commit that both branches can trace back to.

Merging two branches together creates a new commit off of the 
currently checkedout branch containing all of the changes from
both branches.  It is the child of both branches because you can
still track the commits back from both of them.

Git's automatic merging allows for the bulk of changes that do
not directly conflict to pass through without the user having to 
manually change each one.  This saves a lot of time, but has the 
potential to add lines from both that may cause bugs when combined.
Merging manually takes time but is "safer" because it is done by 
a person knowledgable of how the code runs.
