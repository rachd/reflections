You would want to use a remote repository as a backup in case your computer crashes, to access the files from 
multiple computers, and to allow multiple people to work on the same project.

You might always want to pull changes manually in case other group members have posted changes that do not affect
the work you are currently doing.

Forks are copies of public Github repositories.  These are used to capture the content of another person's project 
when you are not a collaborator but want to make your own changes.  Clones copy the repository from Github onto
your computer, which is how you get the fork onto your machine to begin working.  Branches are multiple versions
of a project stored either on your machine or on Github. These are used when you want to have a main version but 
try out other features and need to switch between them easily.

The benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally allows git to know whether merging is necessary and 
what the conflicts might be.

Without git and Github, you would have to send over every file you wanted to share.  This would be tedious and
uncentralized.  Using Github is much easier.

You would want to make changes in a separate branch when you want to make a pull request and prevent your changes
from automatically updating the master file that everyone is collaborating on.
